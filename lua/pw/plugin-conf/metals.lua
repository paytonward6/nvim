-- These are example settings to use with nvim-metals and the nvim built-in
-- LSP. Be sure to thoroughly read the `:help nvim-metals` docs to get an
-- idea of what everything does. Again, these are meant to serve as an example,
-- if you just copy pasta them, then should work,  but hopefully after time
-- goes on you'll cater them to your own liking especially since some of the stuff
-- in here is just an example, not what you probably want your setup to be.

-- Unfamiliar with Lua and Neovim?
--  - Check out https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide
--
-- The below configuration also makes use of the following plugins besides
-- nvim-metals, and therefore is a bit opinionated:
--
-- - https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
--   - hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp for lsp completion sources
--   - hrsh7th/cmp-vsnip for snippet sources
--   - hrsh7th/vim-vsnip for snippet sources
--
-- - https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim for package management
-- - https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap (for debugging)
